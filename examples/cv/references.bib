	abstract = {We recently reported that targeted deletion of Pannexin 1 in neural precursor cells of the ventricular zone impairs the maintenance of these cells in healthy and stroke-injured brain. Here we frame this exciting new finding in the context of our previous studies on Pannexin 1 in neural precursors as well as the close relationship between Pannexin 1 and purinergic receptors established by other groups. Moreover, we identify important gaps in our understanding of Pannexin 1 in neural precursor cell biology in terms of the underlying molecular mechanisms and functional/behavioural outcomes.},

	abstract = {Purpose After cortical stroke, neural precursor cells ({NPCs}) in the distal ventricular zone ({VZ}) proliferate more rapidly and migrate toward the injured cortex. While evidence suggests this can enhance stroke recovery, the underlying molecular mechanisms initiating the response are poorly understood. Here we identified changes in protein expression in the ipsilateral {VZ} early (4 h) after stroke to gain insight into the initial mechanisms involved in {NPC} activation post-stroke. Experimental design Four hours after photothrombotic stroke (or sham surgery control) in the sensorimotor cortex, adult mice (10 stroke, 10 sham) were subjected to cardiac perfusion with {PBS}, and ipsilateral and contralateral {VZ} tissue was microdissected. Two separate sets of ipsilateral and contralateral {VZ} tissues (from 5 pooled surgery or 5 pooled sham mice) were analyzed simultaneously using 8-plex {iTRAQ}. We used Western blotting and confocal microscopy to confirm changes in protein expression in the {VZ} ipsilateral to stroke in a separate cohort of mice. Results We identified nine proteins which exhibited a significant mean increase (by ≥ 2-fold) in stroke ipsilateral compared to sham ipsilateral. Many of these proteins were antiproteases or cytokine/growth factor binding proteins that are known to act as inflammatory responders or effectors and play roles in modulating tissue growth and remodeling. Conclusion and clinical relevance These novel findings support a growing body of literature that inflammatory signaling is involved in the {NPC} response to brain injury and identifies novel potential targets that could be exploited to better understand and to optimize this regenerative response.},

	doi = {10.3389/fncel.2018.00124},
	abstract = {Neurite formation relies on finely-tuned control of the cytoskeleton. Here we identified a novel protein-protein interaction between the ion and metabolite channel protein Panx1 and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (Crmp2), a positive regulator of microtubule polymerization and stabilization. Panx1 and Crmp2 co-precipitated from both Neuro-2a (N2a) cells and mouse ventricular zone tissue. In vitro binding assays between purified proteins revealed the interaction occurs directly between the Panx1 C-terminus and Crmp2. Because Crmp2 is a well-established microtubule-stabilizing protein, and we previously observed a marked increase in neurite formation following treatment with the Panx1 blocker, probenecid, in N2a cells and ventricular zone neural precursor cells, we investigated the impact of probenecid on the Panx1-Crmp2 interaction. Probenecid treatment significantly disrupted the Panx1-Crmp2 interaction by both immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation analysis, without altering overall Crmp2 protein expression levels. In the presence of probenecid, Crmp2 was concentrated at the distal ends of growing neurites. Moreover, probenecid treatment increased tubulin polymerization and microtubule stability in N2a cells. These results reveal that probenecid disrupts a novel interaction between Panx1 and the microtubule stabilizer, Crmp2, and also increases microtubule stability.},
